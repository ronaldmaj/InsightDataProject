# YouTube Comment Management System

Large YouTube channels can have a hard time keeping up to date with all their 
comments. Many thousands of comments can come through on any given video.

Up and coming channels are also interested in finding out more about their 
audience, managing the taxing stress that can come from reading toxic or 
unreasonably negative comments from users. 

This project aims to develop a way for users to easily filter through their
comments, analyse the sentiment of the audience, track loyal commentors,
and gather the general topics that the comments are talking about.

Also find out how this compares to other channels in that category.
