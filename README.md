### Helping Brands Find the Right YouTuber

YouTube is the 2nd most visited website on the internet and 73% of US adults have stated to using the website on a Pew Reearch survey, larger than all other social media platforms [(source)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/).

Sponsoring YouTube channels is one way for companies to tap into this large audience that can actually be targeted quite precisely - individual tastes vary and there are many channels with very specific audiences.

However, with thousands of channels with 1 million or more subscribers, it can be difficult to choose the right one to sponsor. Age, gender and geographic demographic information is available to the channel owners but not to outside marketers. Further, of the available services, none offer a glimpse into __thoughts, interests and opinions of the *most engaged users*__ of these audiences: the commentors.

CommenTube offers channel recommendations based on what these commentors are saying:

Simply type in your a key word or even a whole sentence and CommenTube will reveal the channels with the greatest proportion of relevant comments related to your search term.
