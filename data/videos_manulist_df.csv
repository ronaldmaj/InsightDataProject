Idk about you guys but love languages have completely revolutionized the way I approach certain people and our relationships (like astrology tbh). What are your love languages?

87,qRlQulyGwR0,UCgWfS_47YPVbKx5EK4FLm4A,grateful,"As you may already have heard (or seen), August wasn’t the best month per se. But the growth and awareness that came from it, was. As humans, our struggles vary, but the way they weigh down on us is very similar. I just wanted to say I’m so grateful to have a community of amazing people that recognized that feeling and took a moment to send a supportive message my way. Although everything in life is temporary, sometimes it takes changing your perspective a bit on the situation and pushing through. September, bring it on!

What an incredible experience learning how to make sushi from an expert! I booked this ~3.5 hour lesson through Airbnb and ended up being the only person to book with Chef Nori for his lunch class! We first met at his local grocery store where we went through many ingredients including fish, rice, soy sauce, miso soup components, and more! We then went back to his home where we had a brief history of sushi and then prepared the sushi rice. He then showed me the steps of making nigiri sushi with fluffy play-doh (not shown), and then we went into the real deal. Nori taught me about sushi knives and how to properly cut the fish and then we got into forming the nigiri. He also taught me how to make other kinds of sushi not filmed and then we had a lovely lunch together. I am so grateful to have learned so much from Nori this afternoon and I hope you learned a little bit too!

My Personal Experience @05:21
IUD Pros & Cons @13:11
→ I think I missed a few pros and cons here but a BIG con I forgot to talk about is the fact that this is definitely a commitment - of course you can take it out at any time but you need to have a doctor do it obviously. It’s not like the pill where you can just stop taking it!

Now as you guys may know, I went shopping for my wedding dress a few moons ago - and we found a very wonderful white bat-sleeved dress. However, I've been teasing the idea here and there of doing a white swan/black swan moment and having a second *black* reception dress to change into for the party portion of the evening. So that is what we're going to be working on now!

And now I present to you, part 2 of our 4-part wedding series! We had to make a franken-wedding-something, so why not a cake? We decided to bake an 8-tier wedding cake where each layer is a different cake flavor, and then at the end taste them as tiers and all together. What do you guys think? Do you want a franken-cake at your wedding? Should we keep doing bad culinary science or retire our spatulas for good?

Thank you so much to Rosanna Pansino for helping us bake our cake! You can find her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/RosannaPansino

154,LbPw9AlVKVM,UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA,I Tried Wedding Dresses Through History,"Hello friends! So as some of you may know, I am engaged, betrothed, and affianced - and so I hereby introduce you to part 1 of our 4 part wedding video series! Being the fashion history enthusiast that I am, I decided to do a little exploration into wedding dresses through history and try on 5 authentic vintage wedding dresses (with era-appropriate hairstyling, makeup, and bouquets to boot!) - ranging from the Victorian Era to the 1980s! Which look was your favorite?

Simply Nailogical,"So a few months ago when Cristine was in Los Angeles for VidCon, we decided to drop by the Orly Color Lab in West Hollywood to mix up some custom nail polish colors (with a bit of adult supervision)! We got to make a custom nail polish for each of us as well as mix up a 3rd frankenpolish consisting of all of their polishes together! What do you think of our three shimmery creations?

We're BACK with another frankenlipstick video! And this time, we were able to convince a major makeup company to join us in our bad makeup science lab. We collaborated with Colourpop to bring you guys real, not kitchen-made versions of some of our favorite frankenlipstick shades from over the years, and we also convinced them to help us build a GIANT lipstick! Probably the world's largest, or at least, tallest - but we are unsanctioned by Guinness. Watch as we make one of our collab lipsticks into the Clifford the Big Red Dog of lipstick tubes. What do you guys think? Have I officially lost my marbles?

No, this is not our real wedding, but this is a real thing that McDonald's actually does. Apparently, in Hong Kong, McDonald's got so many requests to host weddings that they now offer wedding packages - with an MC, catering, guest favors, apple pie wedding cakes, french fry kisses, and even balloon bouquets. So I figured, since Tyler & I are engaged - we had to stop by a McDonald's in Hong Kong and (sorta) get married there to see what it was like! What did you think of our McDonald's wedding?

The frankenlipstick giveaway is now CLOSED to new entries - winners will be contacted in the upcoming weeks!

So as you all know, I have done many frankenmakeup experiments over the past couple of years - and about a year ago, I made a mega-franken-lipstick by melting every lipstick from Sephora together - to see, roughly, what the ""average"" lipstick from Sephora would look like. And I've always wondered if that ""average"" would vary from store to store - so I ransacked CVS and bought one of every lipstick they sell there to make into a mega-franken-CVS lipstick. And then we melted down those 500 lipsticks, and made 400 to send to you all!

So I am a huge fan of fancy soaps, in every way, shape, and form - I love smelling soaps, feeling soaps, and using soaps. So I decided - why not try and make a fancy bar of soap, myself, from scratch? So I followed a colorful, swirly cold-process soap art recipe from Soap Queen TV with interesting results.

PS: also, saw the comments about the fiddle leaf fig plant and the cat - thanks for the heads up! for ur peace of mind, crusty is not a leaf chewer at all (and he has not tried with this plant at all either), but we will keep him away from it for sure!

169,mcZdTvOqmvI,UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA,I Tried Wedding Dresses From Wish,"Ok, here it is, finally, after all of your requests! I bought 4 wedding dresses from Wish.com and tried them out IRL to see how they were! We bought a ballgown, a renaissance dress, a black wedding dress, and a slightly more expensive gown to test out a few different categories.

Now, I have previously bought inexpensive clothing, knockoff electronics, ""free"" items, and mostly fake makeup from Wish before, with usually the same results: it's just not that great, and definitely not as good as the item listings seem online. However, I think the convergence of my recent engagement and the desire for more Wish roasting resulted in this: The Wish Wedding Dress Haul. What do you guys think?

172,ysTPxUZnZaU,UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA,I Tried ASMR For The First Time,"And we're back! Here is a video we filmed at the end of last year that I'm excited to finally release! Watch the first half now and save the second half for nap time, lol.

So I've seen a lot of non-ASMR youtubers release ASMR videos in the last few months, so I wanted to do a deep dive into what ASMR is and then try an ASMR segment of my own. Thankfully, I got Gibi of Gibi ASMR to help me figure out what it's all about. What did you think of my ASMR segment? Did you like the haircut roleplay? Did any part give you tingles?

You can check out Gibi's channel here! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6acMV3m35znLcf0JGNn7Q

TYPO: Also, 8:49 isn't Caroline ASMR it's Ting Ting ASMR! So sorry!

173,s3B-qp3U5G0,UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA,Melting Every Candle From Bath & Body Works Together,"Merry Christmas Eve, y'all! Here is a weird video we made where I melt every candle from Bath & Body Works together. I figured - it's worked for a myriad of makeup products like lipsticks and eyeshadows and highlighters - so why not try melting every single candle scent from one store together to see what kind of scent we get? It's not bad makeup science - it's bad holiday science! Or maybe bad wax science. Hmm.

A big thanks to Daniel at Stone Candles for smelling our candle! You can check them out here:

So I finally got these giant ugg mashups and wore them for a week to figure them out and try and style them! What do you think? Would you wear these? Or do you think they are positively UGG-ly?

Or, as the title suggests, try having at it. I also dyed my hair back to my old color for a full hairstyle transformation. What do you think? Would you try this??

So I have done a few bad makeup science experiments before with my own nude lipsticks, foundations, eyeshadows, liquid lipsticks, and highlighters, and I've also mixed together every lipstick from Sephora, but I wanted to think more dramatic this time, so I bought every online beauty guru's eyeshadow palette that was currently available, and we mixed them together into one Frankenguru eyeshadow. What do you think it should be named?

So I've been seeing these bizarre photo and video ""magic"" editing hacks all over Instagram, and they always seem so incredibly strange that I decided to test a bunch of them out and see how they were! We tried a few out from different instagram accounts and pages and ended up jumping into a giant teacup, twirlin' in the man-made rain, doing a heart bokeh effect, knocking on the door to the upside-down, and walking against the grain of society. Troom Troom, what's good?

English Translation:
O my dear papa
I like him, he is handsome, handsome
I want to go to Porta Rossa
To buy the ring!
Yes, yes, I want to go there!
And if my love were in vain,
I would go to the Ponte Vecchio
And throw myself in the Arno!
I am aching, I am tortured!
Oh God, I'd like to die!
Father, have pity, have pity!
Father, have pity, have pity!

I thought I'd share it with you guys and see what moments you might remember! Do you have a favorite iJustine moment? Share in the comments and I'll try to put together an end of the year video featuring some! 

I know some of of you have been here since the beginning and I'm forever grateful. My content has changed a lot of the years and I'm sure some of you will always miss the old iJ, but I'm so happy to have been able to grow up online with all of you. Can't wait for this next chapter! ❤

SNL has been on the air since the beginning of time; long before television was even invented. But... is the show good? Depending on who you ask, you'll get drastically different answers. Here's my opinion.

My favorite SNL sketches of the past few years:
""First Impression"" ► https://youtu.be/tDUv59Yu04Y
""What's That Name?""  ► https://youtu.be/rImxuuD_kwM
""Teacher Fell Down"" ► https://youtu.be/t6UkvhvqkDg
""House Hunters"" ► https://youtu.be/Ntz8KxCxgGQ
""A New Kyle"" ► https://youtu.be/lsSYY-S_sQ4
""The House with Chris Pine"" ► https://youtu.be/mRLrWjBrJe8
""Undercover Office Potty"" ► https://youtu.be/KUzGrzsYqH4

Hollywood makes a lot of decisions predicated on the notion that everyone in the world is an idiot, but there's almost nothing more insulting than when they try to pass off a movie as a sequel when it has literally no connection to its ""predecessor"" other than the fact that they are both movies. And that really grinds my gear (I only have one).

I think it might be too late to say sorry :( Justin Bieber has been doing some very weird things lately, so I decided to go over everything and analyze what went wrong with the ""Yummy"" release and his bizarre desperation to get the #1 spot. 

It might help to hear the song before you watch this video, so here's the link to Yummy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8

Also, Danny and I realized we made a video about the same topic after we both finished editing, so go watch Danny's video if you haven't already!

FOLKS! It's my last video of 2019. Instead of doing a year in review, or a recap, or a rewind, or anything like that; I decided to commemorate this year with a tattoo. I didn't know what to get, so I asked you guys to design my next tattoo, and you did not disappoint. Over 1500 emails and 185,000 votes later, I got a brand new tattoo to remember this amazing year. 

Thank you to everyone who subscribed, liked, commented, laughed, told their friends, listened to my podcast, came to one of my shows; seriously you have no idea how much it means to me. Thank you for an amazing year. SEE U NEXT YEAR, KURTISTOWN!!!!

https://cleo.app.link/kurtis

A few months ago, I made a video called ""I Found The Weirdest Couple Ever"" where I took a close look at the one and only Stephen Harrison. After I uploaded my video, some really weird things started happening. Videos were deleted, captions were altered, and now he's saying that their whole relationship was fake. In this video I take an even closer look and try to figure out what actually happened.

In this episode, I focus on the pattern of how drama is covered (and spread) on youtube, as well as the ethical implications. Is covering drama toxic, unethical, or irresponsible? Let's discuss!! #internetanalysis #spillingtea #commentary

Watch part one: ""Commentary YouTube"" is more than just funny white guys - https://youtu.be/0sB9LaXEYb8

TIME STAMPS:
0:00 - intro
1:23 - the pattern of drama coverage on youtube, using the Nikocado Avocado & Stephanie Soo situation as an example
1:42 - step 1) tea is spilled
2:20 - step 2) audience reactions & response videos
4:22 - step 3) tea channels reupload clips and receipts
4:54 - step 4) Person #2 responds
5:52 - step 5) more reactions, response videos, and drama recaps
8:22 - step 6) involved people continue to make response videos
8:38 - step 7) most viewers lose interest, but videos will still be made as long as some people will still watch
9:12 - we must re-examine if & how we interact with youtube drama
9:46 - sometimes dramatic situations contain important takeaways
10:49 - we can make larger points about the drama that happens online, rather than focusing on trivial details
12:18 - tbt to when I made the mistake of jumping on the bandwagon of ""covering"" the James Charles & Tati situation 
13:13 - drama & commentary channels have a responsibility to admit when we are wrong 
13:31 - are drama and commentary channels ""journalists"" ?
14:32 - the five core principles of journalism, and how they relate to youtubers
17:29 - are drama and commentary channels ""bullying"" ?
18:11 - remember when Jake Paul called Cody Ko a bully?
19:58 - my personal conflict in making videos about other youtubers
20:58 - just watch ContraPoints' video on Canceling, ok ??

TIME STAMPS: 
0:00 - intro
1:37 - all students are told they need a bachelor's degree to be successful
2:03 - shout out to today's sponsor, Amino
2:56 - what exactly is expected of students to be considered ""competitive"" ? highest possible GPA, as many advanced courses as possible, and tons of extracurricular activities
4:36 - your family income level and where you live definitely impact your ability to be a competitive applicant. socioeconomic factors add additional obstacles
5:53 - sharing my perspective - living in an affluent area as a low income, first generation college student, taking advanced / AP courses
7:59 - it's crazy to expect all students to be perfect and well-rounded
8:50 - I also want to address accessibility and privilege. Quality education and certain opportunities aren't available to everyone
9:31 - where do these high standards and pressures come from? self, society, and parents. for example: TIGER MOMS!
10:55 - let's talk about GPA and how APs raise a weighted GPA. Top students these days aim for GPAs close to 5.0.
13:06 -  access to AP scores is very unequal. There are income and race gaps in advanced courses
14:42 - grade inflation is also a thing!! private and suburban public high schools are awarding higher grades (while SAT scores have actually gone down)
17:54 - let's talk about SAT and ACT testing, and the privilege of college prep
20:12 - extracurriculars!! gotta balance a dozen activities to make yourself look well-rounded! students feel compelled to spend every spare moment doing something productive, for the sake of creating an ""impressive"" college application
23:08 - if you're not the strongest academically, though, ECs can help boost your application
24:34 - CONTENT WARNING, self-harm and su*cide (censoring in case youtube's algorithm tries to automatically demonetize / flag this video) -- there are real dangers of being overworked, especially as a high school student

0:00 - intro, what is an MLM?
2:20 - shout out to today's sponsor, Amino
3:15 - why would anyone join an MLM?
3:47 - the perfect ""Boss Babe"" life... aka how MLMs target women
4:15 - moms and military spouses are often targeted
5:14 - whoops I left this title up for way too long but it's not worth it to go back and edit it bc exporting and uploading takes forever BYEE
5:25 - MLMs are predatory, often specifically targeting lower income people
5:54 - MLM starter kits: business investment or huge financial mistake? distributors have to buy their own stock, and hit monthly quotas to remain active
8:10 - MLM sales strategies. Build a team, so you can earn commission from everyone below you
9:21 - message EVERYONE you know, and invite them to your facebook ""business"" page
10:30 - MLM parties + my first experience with MLMs
12:32 - shameless sales tactics. guilt-tripping moms for having jobs outside of the home. taking advantage of lonely people by inviting them to MLM girl boss squads under the guise of friendship
15:23 - more insidious marketing tactics, such as buying followers or otherwise artificially inflating your success in your ""business""
17:11 - what about MLM products tho? are they worth buying? are they good quality?
18:15 - what happens once you're deeply involved in an MLM? your relationships probably will suffer. 
19:30 - the upline relationship is inherently exploitative. they tell you, if you aren't doing well, you're not trying hard enough!
20:45 - the perfect boss babe life is a LIE! let's talk MONEY. how much do people in MLMs make?? we'll look at some income disclosures. spoiler alert: the majority of MLM distributors end up breaking even or losing money.
25:22 - MLMs exist only to enrich the small number of people at the top. at worst, others end up with unsellable stock, in extreme debt.
27:44 - MLMS are a major scam and they ruin lives. but I understand, people take risks when they're desperate for work. Please try to get a legitimate job instead of wasting your time, money, and energy on an MLM.

Watch the video I made for Pill Club's channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UlcWzDl6rc
#internetanalysis #techfreeschool #screentime

In this video, I'm responding to a video about tech-free schools that Silicon Valley parents send their kids to, along with many comments that I found on that video. While underfunded public schools struggle to have the technology their students need, expensive private schools are gaining popularity for cutting down on tech usage.

1:15 - the main video I'm responding to is ""Inside A Tech-Free School Where Tech Executives Send Their Kids""

3:30 - LMK if you want me to make a whole video comparing Waldorf-style schools, VS the heavy emphasis on standardized testing in public schools
3:38 - are low tech schools disadvantaged?
4:56 - tech is on the rise... in well-funded schools
5:16 - the Digital Divide
6:23 - Silicon Valley parents, who work for major tech companies, want to limit their kids' screen time
8:11 - screen time stats and recommendations for kids
9:43 - it is a privilege to be able to limit your screen time. Many parents rely on tech to distract or entertain their kids, sometimes due to not being able to afford quality childcare
11:07 - wealthier parents are able to afford childcare, allowing their kids to spend more of their day away from technology. They can also afford extracurriculars, which can be too expensive for lower income families
12:24 - but won't these Waldorf kids be disadvantaged when it comes to college or potentially pursuing a job in tech??
14:28 - how does screen time affect mental health? or social skills? ps are we really growing horns in the back of our heads from using our phones too much ??
16:10 - I think the benefits of a Waldorf school are much more than just limiting tech usage. They have resources and experiences that most public school students could never even dream of!

383,omsGQUTM2fo,UCY6DpwQetygtye7GM1zVHmw,How Dating Apps Affect Us,"Internet Analysis: dating apps!! finally! this video is an overview of the history of online dating, why we use dating apps, and how they affect our behavior and self-esteem. Enjoy!
#internetanalysis #commentary #datingapps
Cute thumbnail art is by Vicky Leta, Mashable.

We have to deal with so much, dating online! so many different apps and websites: okcupid, PoF, christianmingle, tinder, match, happn, bumble??? We have to make our profiles, judge other people on their photos, reply to too many messages. Plus the worst: bad pick up lines, ghosting, breadcrumbing ??? I'M OVERWHELMED - thank god I have a boyfriend

TIME STAMPS:
0:00 - intro & quick history of online dating
1:16 - the three main types of online dating, according to me: traditional dating websites, dating & hookup apps, and meeting ""organically"" online
2:12 - online dating has become common and normalized. due to technology and people moving to new cities, it's easiest to meet people online
4:07 - why else do people use dating apps?
4:36 - PSA: meeting your partner online is valid!! congrats on finding love! don't let the online dating stigma bother you
5:39 - this vid is a bit heteronormative. the next vid in this series will include how race and sexuality can impact your experience online dating
6:22 - photos and profiles can be misleading. dating sites like match.com or okcupid calculate your compatibility based on how you answer SURVEYS and questionnaires (I love them ok sorry)
7:52 - apps like Tinder are photo-centric. people judge others based on their photos / how photogenic they are. Is it fair to overly edit / Facetune your online dating photos?
10:35 - people judge you based on your profile or photos, but those are not YOU! not the real you, you know??
11:28 - SWIPING. it's addictive. it's dehumanizing. it's the best thing that's ever happened to dating apps tbh
12:18 - dating apps give us TOO MANY OPTIONS
12:59 - a generalization of the behavior of straight people on dating apps AND A CLIP FROM CONTRAPOINTSSS BLESS HER
14:44 - how do dating apps affect our self-esteem? do people use dating apps for validation? how can we have a healthy relationship with these apps?
16:37 - people behave terribly on dating apps and they're pretty bad at communication. having so many other options at your fingertips can cause people to be careless or disrespectful
19:40 - many people get trapped in the online dating cycle, with endless swiping, chats, meetups, then back to swiping. What happens when we distract ourselves from rejection?
20:23 - more inconsiderate, unhealthy behaviors, such as ghosting and breadcrumbing
22:45 - are there any ways for us to make online dating better?

384,iNPWohmJPyk,UCY6DpwQetygtye7GM1zVHmw,"Dote - An Example of Selective ""Diversity""","Many of you requested that I discuss the Dote scandal - segregated housing at Coachella, token representation of POC, lack of size inclusion, and more. It's a long one but I hope y'all enjoy! TIME STAMPS BELOW. #internetanalysis #dote #dotechella


0:00 - intro
0:22 - what is Dote? Dote trips, such as Fiji, Coachella
1:07 -  how all the quirky teen vloggers (Emma Chamberlain, Ellie Thumann, Hannah Meloche, Summer McKeen, etc) became the Dote Girls… mostly white, thin, pretty, and popular.
2:35 - a few girls of color get added to the Dote trip groups, but they’re still very white
3:28 - Dotechella 2019 and segregated housing… Itskeisha started the discussion. Why were girls of color put into a living room with beds out of couches, where the (mostly) white girls were in nice rooms with bunk beds, on the other side of the house.
5:51 - many Dote girls (of color) and other channels start to discuss the lack of diversity in Dote and on youtube
7:00 - I’m so proud to see so many young girls discussing these issues and their experiences as people of color… and white people need to chime in too and talk about this. use your white privilege!
8:39 - Eris doesn’t think Dote had bad intentions
9:15 - was the Coachella housing segregation intentional? are there any explanations for putting the girls of color in a separate, lesser living situation? the house felt very cliquey bc a lot of the white girls were already close friends
12:55 - the girls of color were often treated differently. Kianna Naomi said that the photographers did not want to take pictures of her (and the other girls of color). they felt unwelcome and uncomfortable
14:30 - Dote’s instagram clearly favored the white girls, then throws in a photo featuring one of the girls of color… for diversity.
15:30 - Eris felt like she had a generally good experience at Dotechella
16:17 - why didn’t any of these girls speak out sooner?
17:59 - Dote’s lack of diversity… their instagram used to be full of photos of Ellie, Hannah, Summer, etc. Once in a while they’d feature a photo of a girl of color. Dote also lacks size inclusivity, like Brandy Melville. To be a Dote girl, you must be thin, and (mostly) white.
19:13 - Dote’s apology statement from the founder…
19:41- the AUDACITY to start posting “This is what Dote looks like” with never before seen photos of “diversity” … Dote has clearly deleted tons of their (white) photos to make their feed look more diverse.
21:00 - who is the diverse group of Dote girls? Texas trip for smaller influencers, including Red Luna Journal. Dote never posted their photos, until now
23:00 - it’s so gross for Dote to use the Texas trip girls as representative of their diversity. Dote also had a “diverse” trip for girls of color, who went to a NY trip. 
24:00 - how have the white Dote Girls responded? are they racist? are they to blame for these situations? nah but they are privileged and have definitely been cliquey
27:50 - advice for Dote… listen to these girls. Stop using girls of color to prove you’re inclusive. Get POC on your team as managers, photographers, hair stylists.

3:56 - the definition of sex positivity, from Hannah Witton
5:12 - if you don't participate in hookup culture, are you a prude? should young people be focused on being single and ""free"" rather than getting ""tied down"" in relationships?
7:50 - sponsored moment, brought to you by Function of Beauty!
9:01 - what motivates people to participate in hookup culture? why the fear of catching feelings?
10:31 - media portrayals of hookup culture. are we the first generations to hookup so casually? what about ""free love"" in the 1960s?

20:02 - hookup culture creates unhealthy expectations for everyone. watch the documentary ""Liberated - The New Sexual Revolution"" on netflix! toxic masculinity... men often have to prove their manliness through sex. rather than rebelling against the patriarchy, is hookup culture actually reinforcing the patriarchy??? IDK!!!
22:40 - hookup culture may make it difficult to learn / practice how to have a healthy relationship

Should you grow it out? Stay ~ au naturel ~ ??? Is it gross? Unhygienic? If you want to remove some hair, how should you do it? Trim? Shave? Wax? SO MANY (painful and costly) OPTIONS.

389,A68ddO_AKiU,UCY6DpwQetygtye7GM1zVHmw,"The Worst Things about ""No Longer Vegan"" Videos","Internet Analysis: ""no longer vegan"" videos. I myself am vegan so I thought it'd be fitting to finally discuss what I think about the increasing number of youtubers quitting veganism. TIME STAMPS BELOW, if you'd like to skip around.

Most recently, Rawvana and Raw Alignment announced that they are no longer vegan. As always, the vegan community has been posting response videos. In this video, I discuss my thoughts, and what I believe are the worst things about these ex-vegan videos.

TIME STAMPS:
1:02 - what inspired me to go vegan in 2015
1:28 - misinformation in the vegan YouTube community. Restrictive diets such as raw, raw til 4, HCLF, no oil... plus juice cleanses and water fasts.
2:24 - ridiculous claims that veganism cures everything
2:58 - no longer vegan because they got sick
3:22 - response videos guess what went wrong and make suggestions
3:41 - restrictive diets can cause deficiencies or gut damage
4:59 - the lie that vegans don't need to worry about getting enough protein or other nutrients
5:50 - the ""pure"" section of vegans who are anti-supplement
6:12 - I personally didn't supplement for years, but now I do
6:46 - the importance of getting blood tests done
7:05 - ex vegans were sick but still selling e-books and posting what they eat in a day
7:44 - many still have their vegan videos public and monetized
7:59 - fish and eggs, the magical cure?
9:17 - what are better ways to address health struggles on a vegan diet?
10:21 - these creators should warn their viewers not to make the same mistakes, and they shouldn't share their new diets or experiments
11:19 - common comments on no longer vegan videos, including that they're bad for veganism or were bribed by animal agriculture?
12:18 - they were NEVER vegan / they were fake vegan
12:46 - vegan for the animals VS for the environment or health
14:03 - elitist veganism, you must be perfect
14:36 - vegan to carnivore.. wtf
15:22 - can people really be vegan forever? is it sustainable?

406,-1is7e6ErkU,UC9gFih9rw0zNCK3ZtoKQQyA,I Made Two Videos And They Were Both Bad,"I'm aware that filming editing and uploading all on the same day is a terrible plan, it always has been and always will be, and there has been many times where I have filmed and edited on different days or ahead of time.  All are fine, and at the end of the day it's just what I find fun and enjoyable.  It also gives me the time in my week to do our podcast, my siriusxm radio show, and live stream on twitch. I feel really bad I just couldn't make something fun today, I really tried my best.  And I will say that VR is super super fun and I know there are a lot of games (especially horror lol) that you guys have asked me to play because you want me to suffer and have nightmares.  I promise we will keep working and tinkering with the format and find really enjoyable games to not only play but watch as well.  And I'm also very sorry that I couldn't make a hot wheels ramp in my hair because it would have been. SO. FUN.  Perhaps I could revisit it someday in the future.  Anyways thanks for understanding, or not, that's fine too, and I'll see you guys next week.

413,4R6uNXAw9tM,UC9gFih9rw0zNCK3ZtoKQQyA,Taking Our Greyhound To The Beach For The First Time,"Although I really appreciate everyone’s suggestions about off leash dog beaches in southern CA,  please understand that Bunny was born and bred to race, was registered to race and spent at least some portion of her life on a racing tack. She is a sighthound, she will take off whenever she sees something to chase and will not respond to commands,
 it is her nature. We can train her to the best of our ability but part of adopting a rescue greyhound is agreeing that your dog will never be off leash unless they are in a fully fenced in environment (or are on a leash). They are very different dogs in that sense and no matter how much we would love to let her run on a beach, even an off leash dog beach,  safety already comes first and foremost with her.  Even well trained former racing Greys can have this as a safety issue, and we would never let her run free unless we were in a fully fenced in environment.  I hope you all can understand why this is the safest and best way currently in our state for her to enjoy the beach and if you are curious about rescue greyhoudsntonjist have a quick look on the internet. They are wonderful companions but do require some extra safety measures due to their ... well sighthoundedness lol.

418,4VosRKPBGE8,UC9gFih9rw0zNCK3ZtoKQQyA,Corn on the Cob But Instead of the Corn Bone It's A Hotdog,"I'm Sorry. 

Here's Jason's Twitch stream if you're ever looking for him (just please I ask that you don't spam, just go say hi and be nice if you're going to go, that would be really great) https://www.twitch.tv/jasonsulli

The Corn Dog recipe I used (with vegan/gf substitutes, actually turned out fantastic, highly recommend if you're trying to get your corn dog on lol) https://www.theslowroasteditalian.com/2018/08/disneyland-corn-dogs-copycat-recipe.html

Also because I saw a lot of you laughing about the Sasquatch clip in the comments, here is the video that Jason's mod Scarfee put together of the very first time Jason Sasquatched.  This was (I believe) in 2017 when PUBG first came out so this was a pretty wild concept to most of us.  He then later went on to SasquatchTM in many twitch rivals tournaments and Squatchran at Shroud butt naked with his red hair out and it was just 10/10.  He has also been known to turn on area chat, naked and in a bush, and just say.... ""dad?"" several times.  Jason is a legend.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY-6YQSlK9I

419,5VErxiXnCVA,UC9gFih9rw0zNCK3ZtoKQQyA,Hydro Dipping A Pair of Crocs,"Obviously... the main problem with my hydro dipped pair of crocs is that they are just too cool to even exist I'm kidding we for some reason picked up acrylic spray paint instead of regular spray paint, although I'm not 100% sure if regular spray paint would work better or worse, probably just differently or at least not crack and flake off as easily.  But yes I wound up with just essentially painted crocs WHICH IS STILL BADASS AND YES I LEAVE AN ART TRAIL WHEREVER I GO.  But will probably eventually flake off entirely even with the layer of sealant.  I would definitely recommend this form of fun having however!  I had a 10/10 time doing it and although I would have liked to have had a beautiful long lasting pair of crocs to wear, I think I might give it another go with a different type of paint and absolutely love the effect it created.  Below are the clips that I used from people (more successfully and knowledgeably) hydro dipping sneakers as well a pair of crocs that *deeply* inspired me so at least their shoes came out better than mine.  But I'm still going to wear mine anyways.  I don't really care.  I hope this inspired you to have some hydro dip fun in the future or to check out some videos on youtube because they are in fact very relaxing to watch.  Anyways I gotta go vacuum everything my feet touched.  Goodbye have a good day.

The Grammy's are coming up this week, so to celebrate I am joined with one of my FAVORITE 3-time Grammy winners, Scott Hoying of Pentatonix! The game is pretty simple - we're going head-to-head to see who can guess the most amount of Grammy-nominated songs this year... but with a TWIST: all of the songs will be played backwards! Enjoy as we dish on celebrity run-ins with Beyonce, Lizzo, and more - and make sure to SUBSCRIBE (press the bell button!), LIKE this video and COMMENT below who do you think will pick up a Grammy this year.

It has been a SECOND since I released my *NEW YORK BEST SELLING* book ""Binge"". As with all things, not EVERYONE loved it, and some even decided to spill their negative thoughts online (as one does). At the time I might have been a bit more sensitive, but today I am going to go through some of the worst reviews of my book and will be performing them for you in the only way I know how... ASMR. Comment below what you think I should do in ASMR next, and make sure to LIKE this video, and SUBSCRIBE (by pressing the bell button below)!

Happy 2020, y'all!! It's always fun to make resolutions and predict what will happen to us each year- but it's even MORE fun to do it for our favorite celebrities. So, I'm using the powers bestowed upon me when I visited a psychic last year, to try and predict 20 celebrity futures for 2020. Who will be dating? Who's getting a divorce? Who's dropping an album and whose nudes are leaking? Join me and ALL of my favorite celebrity friends (from Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, and more) and comment what celebrity prediction you have for the year. Make sure to give this a video a LIKE while you're at it, and SUBSCRIBE (which includes making sure that bell button is pushed)!

Merry Christmas and happy [insert the favorite winter holiday of your choosing]!! At the beginning of the year, I set a resolution to learn a new instrument in 2019. You may have assumed that would be the piano lessons I've spoken about multiple times throughout the last 12 months... but you would be WRONG!! I have been practicing for this moment since last year when I saw a viral video of a mom doing a full body concert of Christmas carols using hand bells. SO for your holiday pleasure, here are four holiday classics performed on body bells by yours truly!! Happy Holidays, y'all!! (Make sure to like this video, subscribe (and press that darn bell button), and comment below what song I should learn next!)

What REALLY happened at Chrissy Teigen’s Hulu Reality Show Party


If you know me, you know I LOVE reality TV, and so when I got the invite to Chrissy Teigen's Hulu Reality TV party I just about died. We were there to shoot some of those hilarious commercials Chrissy has been making for Hulu, but being in a room full of reality tv stars, I was starstruck. There were some of the most ICONIC characters from ""The Bachelor"", ""90 Day Fiance"", ""The Masked Singer"" & more, mingling and ... let's just say there was some drama.

I have always loved puppets growing up. From ""Sesame Street"", ""The Muppets"", ""Fraggle Rock"", and ""Dark Crystal""- they defined my childhood and so I jumped at the chance to find out how they are made. So today, we are visiting Swazzle Puppet Studios who have made ICONIC puppets from ""The Simpsons"", ""Little Mermaid Live"", ""Crank Yankers"" and more - to see the magic behind creating and puppeteering puppets as I turn into one myself! LIKE this video, SUBSCRIBE (hit the bell button, no seriously, it works!), and COMMENT below your favorite puppet!

WELL WE DID A THING. I had heard a lot about these themed 5K runs on Grace & Mamrie's podcast (It Might Get Weird) so I knew we had to try one when the time came. For Universal Studios Hollywood's most recent 5K themed to ""Jurassic World"", Grace and I got up at the crack of dawn dressed as Dr. Hammond and the dilophosaurus from the original ""Jurassic Park"". I was TOLD by an unnamed source that EVERYONE would dress to the theme... and well, you'll see when you watch.

For as long as I can remember, I've had disposable cameras to capture random moments from my life. I recently found a few that I never developed so today I am going to reveal those photos for the first time and tell some stories about what could have been happening. Get ready for some nostalgia, as we revisit old conventions, YouTubers and collabs with some of my favs. Comment below your favorite memory we've shared together, like this video and subscribe!

It's Halloween season, so I brought my friends back together to carve pumpkins for another little challenge. The name of the game is pretty simple: everyone has 30 minutes to transform their gourd into a drag queen fit for the GAWDS. Of course with this group it comes with plenty of laughs, surprises and QUESTIONABLE choices - but like this video, comment below who you think should have won and subscribe!!

I've been a part of most if not all of the big social platforms we've had on the internet - from Myspace, Xanga, Live Journal, Facebook, etc - BUT I have resisted on joining the now-popular Tik Tok. I honestly didn't know much about it except that I'd hear rumblings of lip syncing tweens getting famous for their sped up covers of songs. SO, today I am joining the app for the first time to see what it's all about, watching what's trending on the app and making my first Tik Tok video. Make sure to SUBSCRIBE (click the bell why don't ya?) LIKE this video, COMMENT below what you want me to do on Tik Tok next and...

When I met Napoleon Jinnies on the Abercrombie Pride campaign photoshoot this year, I knew I wanted to find a way to collaborate - and there was no better way than to learn about his claim to fame, being a pro NFL cheerleader! He was one of the first male cheerleaders to ever perform at the Super Bowl and we spent the afternoon preparing me for my own NFL cheerleading routine ala ""Bring it On"".

Last week I had the MOST incredible night - I got invited to the Haus Laboratories launch party with the QUEEN Lady Gaga herself... and let's just say things got messy (in the best ways). In this video I share the secrets of what happened in the party, what Gaga and I caught up about and I even attempt to give myself a Haus Labs makeover (eek!).

A couple weeks ago I saw a story on Twitter about how Country music queen Kacey Musgraves needed a last minute photoshoot, so she went to a local LA portrait studio called ""Tom's One Hour Photo Lab"". The store's business had slowed down significantly since it opened almost 30 years ago and so Kacey posted about how much she loved the experience and her photos - making Tom a viral sensation. So naturally I got a reservation and I brought my BFF Korey along with me for a SISTERS photoshoot.with Tom. Make sure to LIKE, SUBSCRIBE, and comment your FAVORITE Kacey track in honor of our local-business-supporting LEGEND!

BACK IN MY DAY the MTV VMA's were THE place for iconic moments in music each year. From career defining moments like Britney's ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", stunt-y collabs like THE popstar kiss and the whole Miley-Robin Thicke situation and of course the candid pop culture moments we still talk about today (Taylor-Kanye-Beyonce-gate). SO, to celebrate the VMAs tonight, I am reacting to some of the most memorable VMA moments in history! Make sure the subscribe, like this video and comment below with YOUR favorite VMA moment!

I have seen celebrities endorse and swear by the strangest things that keep them healthy - but today I'm trying one of the wildest celebrity health regimens I've ever seen. In an interview, Grimes (musician and girlfriend of Elon Musk) said she does everything from sword fighting, hours in a deprivation tank, a screaming session and more in her daily routine... and I decided to try it all. Make sure to like this video, comment with the strangest celebrity endorsement you've seen and make sure to subscribe!

Life has been going great lately... so why not try to mess with fate!! A few weeks ago, I decided to buy some ""cursed"" items off ebay - everything from dolls, demon dust, and SURPRISE mystery boxes.

It’s Fourth of July - which means BBQ’s, fireworks and a bunch of PATRIOTISM! To celebrate, I’m taking a test, to see if I can guess where each state is in on country (it’s harder than you think!!). With every state I get wrong, I’m paying my dues and donating $100 to the Trevor Project for their “50 Bills 50 States” campaign. Please like this video, subscribe, and comment below how many you got right (and what you’re donating!) Happy Fourth of July! 

Please use the donation function on this video, to help me raise money for The Trevor Project and their “50 Bills 50 States” campaign to end conversion therapy in the US!

To commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, I’ve been working on a special little video all about the impact Stonewall had on what we now celebrate as LGBTQ+ Pride. Before there were the festivals, parades and concerts, there was the Christopher Street Liberation Day March - a year after Stonewall. I partnered with my friends Matt Riemer and Leighton Brown (of the Instagram account @LGBT_History) to share the stories of the first Pride March. Please like this video, subscribe and share and comment below your first Pride experience. #Stonewall50

To celebrate Pride Month, we are back with a drag makeover - but with a special guest and a new twist! Today I’m joined by none other than the Pride of Rupaul’s Drag Race Season 11 (and newly crowned Miss Congeniality)- Nina West!! Instead of Nina doing MY makeover however, we will be back to back and she will have to instruct me how to paint my own face! (Spoiler - it doesn’t go as planned). Subscribe, like this video and comment below what you think my West Drag name should be!!

at this point, it seems like EVERYONE is selling rainbow everything to ""celebrate"" pride month, but I think it's important for brands to put their money where their mouth is and find ways to actually SUPPORT the community too. So that's why I was so excited when I was asked to be a model for Abercrombie & Fitch's #FaceYourFierce Pride Campaign- since they are donated proceeds from the collection to The Trevor Project! If tween Tyler could only see me now! From getting free samples in my local Michigan mall back in the day - I can't believe I'm actually an Abercrombie model. Make sure to like this video, subscribe and comment below what makes you fierce!

512,gbyy7TugxpU,UCJ6kxrH8SKz9BiSJ--xeh1A,"Magic Crystal Healing Sound Bath (Meditation, Sleep, ASMR)","Magic Crystal Healing Sound Bath (Meditation, Sleep, ASMR)
What are Sound Baths? 
Sound baths are deeply restorative, healing, and calming. The sounds of the bowls can allow you to go deeper into meditation, to take away anxiety and depression, and to cleanse your chakra and aura. 

As you allow yourself to relax, bring your mind to the breath and the sounds of the instruments. If your mind starts to wander, gently come back to the breath. It’s ok if your mind wanders, it is natural. Go easy on yourself. Everything is happening as it should. 

Why do I feel different after listening?
Sound healing is a form of vibrational healing. 
Our body is 60% of water. As I play the bowls, the water in your body is vibrating. The chemistry of your body is changing. The vibrations in the pure sound of the bowls are raising the vibrations in your body. 

Make sure to drink lots of water. You need to cleanse your body of anything that doesnt serve you.

Crystal sound healing has the ability to heal those with anxiety, depression, and trauma. This video may affect you on a deep level. Be gentle with yourself. If you feel emotions coming up, allow them to arise. Release. Allow yourself to cry. It is all part of the healing process. It also may help to journal about what you are feeling and releasing. 

Why are you making this video? 
 I fell in love with the sound of the crystal singing bowls about a year ago and have recently begun giving sound baths. 

I have noticed immense changes in myself after playing and listening to crystal healing bowls. I felt extremely called to share this healing with all of you. Part of me is nervous to venture so out of the norm of my typical content, but I know this will help so many people and that it is part of my purpose and my path. 

I hope this video brought you light and that you resonated with it. I love you and I am here for you. 

Thank you so much to Be Crystal Clear for allowing me to use their studio! They have amazing Sound Baths - if you live in LA I highly recommend!

We loved the long adventure in the woods to get there and enjoyed being outside in nature with our favorites.

In this video my sister Saige and I thought it would be a good idea to switch lives with Mia and be pregnant for the day!! So we both put on pregnancy bellies and surprised her! Being pregnant for a day made Saige and I really appreciate what Mia is going through and we had so much fun experiencing it with her! We tried on maternity clothes, looked for baby outfits and toys, went to a doctors appointment and more. We are so excited to meet our little niece, and we hope you guys are too!

If you apply to be our business, here's what we're looking at:

1. You'll get $50,000
2. You'll get mentorship and advice
3. You'll get the support of Nerdfighteria

1. You'll give the $50,000 back to decrease maternal mortality in Sierra Leone if you can within three years.
2. You'll give 10% of all after-tax profit to strengthen public health in Sierra Leone forever. If your business sells, you will give 10% of whatever money you make selling the business to that same effort.

694,t1-P8eL81FA,UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA,The Thing I would Like to End,"There are some pretty dramatic simplifications in here. For example, I did not talk about beta readers or perspective readers. For me, after the main revision is done, I send the book to a half-dozen or so people who have things in common with my characters that I don't. Race, gender, nationality, age, socio-economic status, education, sexual orientation, etc. That's one of my favorite parts of the process and gets spread out over a number of months. 

Anyway, as John said, A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is available for pre-order now! http://www.hankgreen.com

Our Tour is Next Week: http://www.hankandjohn.com/appearances

Originally when writing this video there was quite a lot more about nails and stress and also about how the mindless acquisition of something that previously held value beyond any objective utility creates more stress than it alleviates, but then it got to be a LOT about money and not a lot about community so I'm saving that for later. But if you noticed the ghost of that argument hiding in this video...well done. 

Also, I made this video yesterday, so I didn't have time to consider the geopolitics of January 3, 2020. However, I am also not an expert on Iran, so I basically have nothing useful to say except, ""It's ok to not know what's going on right now. It's going to take a while before anyone knows.""

698,pZ3OMf01xJs,UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA,Why I'm Worried about 2020,"We are used to moving forward...so much so that moving back a little bit could seem really big and really scary to people. I feel like we've moved back some, particularly when it comes to global faith in democracy. I think that's a hit that was brought on by the social internet, but also by increasing inequality, and political pundits, operatives, and TV news that wants people to be as freaked out as possible.

Prehensile-Tailed Porcupines live throughout central and South America, making their lives in the canopy eating fruits, leaves, shoots, and other delicious vegetation. In the wild, they would not talk as much as Kemosabe, because they wouldn't want to call attention to themselves and Kemo is, apparently, more vocal than most captive porcs. But that is definitely our gain because I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

Watch - http://www.projectforawesome.com/live

The Project for Awesome is our community's yearly fundraiser. Money donated at http://projectforawesome.com/donate is, for the first half of the P4A, given to Partners in Health and Save the Children. Our company pays for all non-volunteer staff time so, after manufacturing and shipping costs for perks, all of the money goes to charity. 

During the second half, the money raised goes to charities voted on by the community at ProjectforAwesome.com. People all over the internet make videos promoting their favorite charities and people watch those videos and then vote for the ones they think most deserving. 

We also have a 48 hour livestream which is very fun!

713,_AQVUgSi_Ok,UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA,The Good Place and Modern Morality: Can You Be a Good Person in 2019?,"The third season of The Good Place made me think a lot of things. Like, too many for a four minute video, but also, I think I managed to shove a lot in here. 

One thing I didn't get it as that there's actually a bad side to the way folks like me like to engage with the world. There's the curiosity about why the world is the way that it is, that's good. There's a desire to make the world better, that's good. But there is also a real interest in, like, just finding reasons why things are bad. It's a cognitive bias towards ""the world sucks"" and I kinda hate it. It's generally strongest in backlash to the popularity of something, and I kinda hate it. 

I think people can sometimes conflate a desire to care for the world with a desire to tear down LITERALLY EVERYTHING. And when people actually do get off on tearing things down just for the fun of it, it delegitimizes the real problems. Folks who like to see things in a fairly simple way see that behavior and they think, ""Oh, that's just liberals, they hate everything.""

We need to do more than hate, we need to see the world through more than just the lens of judgement and objectivism. I want to talk more about this soon!!!

Pallas' Cat is more closely related to house cats than many wild cats (though not as close as some) but still split off from any of it's ancestors 5 to 6 million years ago. For comparison, our ancestors were still interbreeding with the ancestors of chimpanzees six million years ago. 

But they do have this one strange feature that doesn't make any sense. But despite the fact that it probably doesn't help them survive, it does make them cute to humans...so if it convinces us to keep captive breeding programs...this less-than-useless attribute may actually (oddly enough) save them.

Honestly, I've really streamlined my routine ALOT over the past year. I try to really choose what's most important for me to accomplish during my time when the kids are at school, and when they are home from school I'm in full Mom mode (helping with homework, playing outside, cooking dinner etc.) I very rarely film those moments because I'm just trying to be in the moment. I try to balance my energy with house work, business, and also my own personal growth and development (self care). This is an example of my personal routine aside from my family time. 

Four Sigma Recommendations & Tips: I recommend sticking with Chaga in the morning to start the day off right, Cordyceps before being active (or for an energy boost without the caffeine!), Lion's Mane when you need some help concentrating during work, and Reishi in the evening as the best kind of night cap.  All of the mushrooms can also be consumed throughout the day, whenever they are needed most!  The entire catalog is vegan and gluten-free!

832,zeVvTF43aFM,UCM3P_G21gOSVdepXrEFojIg,"Deeper Self Care Habits (Peace, Serenity & Calm)","I believe self care goes deeper than taking a bath, exercising, applying skincare & drinking more water. Honestly, self care ultimately goes beyond even your own goals and aspirations. As I've gotten older I've realized that self care is letting go of ego, owning your issues & challenging yourself. It's caring for your mental health and seeking help if needed. Caring for your soul and how to be of use to others. Being conscious and open to growth and change. It's prayer and reflection. Being patient with yourself and others. Self care is non judgement. Ultimately, it's a journey we are all on. You can look to other people and think they have a ""perfect life"", but ultimately everyone fights their own battles and demons, and we're all on a journey to find purpose and meaning in this life. I've personally been spending more time simplifying. Time with my family and pets outdoors, having quiet time everyday, and focusing on what I'm truly passionate about. These are a few things I like to do to feel more peace, serenity, and calm in my own body & personal life.

So, although I believe self care goes much deeper than just working out, bubble baths and facials I still believe we should carve out some time in addition to the inner work to pamper our physical bodies and show ourselves some self love. I hope you find this inspiring and create a night time self care ritual for yourself. =)

834,huiGmjxSlkA,UCM3P_G21gOSVdepXrEFojIg,DIY Afternoon Clothesline Project +  2 Tips To Simplify Laundry Routine,"Hey guys! We finally got around to a project we've been meaning to finish + I wanted to share 2 tips to simplify your laundry routine..

Since I was watching the boys while trying to film this video, I didn't get a chance to film all the details of how to create the clothesline, but 
if you'd like to build a similar clothesline here's some measurements- 

You'll need 3 4x4's 8 foot tall wood pieces. Cut one of those in half and used 8 inch wood screws  to create the T. Brace with two pieces of 2x4s cut at 45 degree angles 21 inches long.

We didn't use clothesline, but we recently bought some to add in the coming days because what we used will likely stretch out over time. Drill holes on both sides of the T's to put in some eye bolts. We put in three on both sides. Loop the clothesline through and tighten. To create added resistance my husband also added a line to the bottom back of the clothesline going into eye bolts in the ground and secured the line.

835,jqELTO-bwY8,UCM3P_G21gOSVdepXrEFojIg,Updated Hair Routine (Summer 2019),"Hey guys! This has been my hair routine for the past few weeks. In the summer I love to step up my oil and scalp treatments. Also, since my hair is naturally wavy it tends to be my favorite hair style. I'm happy I found this wave styler because I think it takes my natural hair to that next level. I always love simple additions that make a huge difference. 

Bed Head ""Wave Artist"" Wave Styler https://amzn.to/2K8pkmO

Add a little bit of coconut oil to your hair and let it sit overnight or for as long as possible. 

Green Tea Jasmine Hair Rinse-
Steep 2 bags of Green Jasmine Tea
(I used regular green tea and let jasmine flowers from my garden infuse into the tea for 2 hrs.)
Store in the fridge for a wonderful summer finishing hair rinse. You can use this after conditioning your hair. It should last in the fridge for up to 3 rinses.

836,6hrLQWZ9ZPA,UCM3P_G21gOSVdepXrEFojIg,Weekend In My Life VLOG,"Hey guys!! This is what I've been up to lately.. haha pretty chill and boring, but thought I'd share since I know I've been so bad about posting consistently on this channel. I've just been soaking up life and enjoying this summer.. When I do that I end up getting inspired for new videos and I have some new ideas I'm excited to film soon! This past weekend we spent most of the time working on our property. Oliver and Byron went wall rock climbing at a local place they both love, and I spent Saturday night working at a studio in the city. I actually LOVE these chill weekends. They are a great time to get some work done around the house, hang with our boys and be creative. I filmed this on my iPhone so it's not DSLR quality. Just FYI =) I hope you enjoy!


MY SPOTIFY- My music is kinda all over the place right now. I've been having fun and growing as a musician the last several years. Right now I'm working on an album for myself and writing for other projects as well, so it will be more streamline in the near future. You can find me on Spotify, Apple music, iTunes etc. Just search my name. I will keep you posted on everything here.  =)

837,-Yl_pO4aZLc,UCM3P_G21gOSVdepXrEFojIg,"Natural Remedies (Elderberry, Fire Cider, CBD, Gemstone Mat)","Hey guys! I wanted to share some remedies I've been using for battling illness and pain in our home.. I've been struggling with chronic pain flare ups for the past year or so, so I've tried to find holistic approaches and keep my diet as clean as possible to prevent them.
 
I'm currently enrolled in the intermediate herbal course: http://theherbalacademy.com

Elderberry Syrup-

1/2 Cup Elderberries 
2 Cups Water
1 Tablespoon Ginger 
2 Cinnamon Sticks
3 Whole Cloves

Bring this mixture to a boil and let it simmer for 45 min. 
Bring to room temperature before adding equal parts honey. 

Fire Cider-
3-4 Garlic Cloves
1 tsp Grated Ginger
1 tsp Horseradish 
Dash of Cayenne 
Cover Apple Cider Vinegar 


De-Stress Calming Tea Blend - 
Chamomile, Lemon Balm & Catnip is a great calming tea blend for both adults and children. I make a cup for my boys and they love it with some local honey. 

CBD Bath Bombs 
http://www.KushQueen.com

CBD Tincture-  
DISCLAIMER- I speak of THC only if it's legal where you live AND you are of age.. Also, with this particular tincture it is a micro dose of 1mg of THC to 11mg of CBD.. The CBD counteracts negative side affects of THC and you get superior pain relief with no psychoactive effects . I take one dose before bed time and I've had amazing results with zero side effects. I highly recommend speaking with your doctor before using any of my recommendations. I'm just sharing what has worked for me.

Everybody's talking about the NEW Roxanne by Arizona Zervas (2019), but let's not forget about the original Roxanne by The Police (1978). I thought it would be funny to cover and create a mashup of both hit pop songs. Also, assuming Arizona Zervas is singing about the same Roxanne as Sting did back in 1978 that means she must be 65+ years today. My boi Arizona is into the cougars and I wrote and added a rap part addressing that.

994,R5mvPUkMI8w,UC9SVhrnsGxWwiBRWT9c7Ozw,People say my channel is dying. Here’s why they’re wrong.,"Is my channel dying? A lot of people seem to think so. I've read it repeatedly in the comments, and today I wanted to have a serious talk about it.

In today's video I read your comments and try my best answering personal, hard and mean questions. I used to get millions of views on my videos but now they usually hover around 2-300k views. Naturally this causes people to say things like ""Your channel is dying."" Things aren't always the way they seem though and right now I actually get more views in total than I used to. Changing my content from purely singing to also include comedy and funny reactions and on top of it doing daily videos is of course a big change and a huge experiment, but sometimes I feel like people create ""drama"" out of nothing like saying some Youtubers channels are dead when it's not necessarily the truth.

997,fK00fXfNErQ,UC9SVhrnsGxWwiBRWT9c7Ozw,I Recorded A Song In VR (And it sounds EPIC),"Today I dive deeper into creating and recording music in virtual reality with EXA: The Infinite Instrument. I wrote, arranged and recorded the instrumental in EXA, exported the stems and recorded vocals and mixed the song in Pro Tools. It was a lot of fun to play around with and there's definitely potential to create really ambitious pieces within the app.

999,SmbG9BUR_Q0,UC9SVhrnsGxWwiBRWT9c7Ozw,HOW DOES THIS SOUND SO GOOD?!,"Today I try Electronauts which is a music editor in VR that looks and sounds absolutely amazing.
It's not a typical DAW where you record and create your own music. It's more of an audio/visual experience where you get to become a DJ in virtual reality who control and manipulate the stems of famous pop and edm songs. We also take a look at the new Panic at the disco 360 levels for Beat Saber and try out EXA, the infinite instrument. If you like music and VR you should definitely try these games yourself on Oculus, PSVR, HTC Vive or Valve Index.

Follow Me on Instagram: http://bit.ly/emily-instagram

Creating fashion and outfits videos usually require you to spend some money either to create a haul (yes, even if it’s a thrift haul you’re still spending money), and I wanted to do something that wouldn’t cost me any money to make, so here is a video with my 5 current favorite outfits! You’ve probably seen me wear them to death on Instagram, but yes, I repeat outfits and I’m not embarrassed about it!

Follow me on Instagram: http://bit.ly/emily-instagram

I don’t know about you, but 2020 feels like it’s going to be a great year and fresh start, not only because it’s a new year, but it’s also the beginning of a new DECADE. AHH! I’ve also been doing a lot of mental declutter (if you will), and really trying to set myself up for success in 2020. Not only does mental decluttering make a huge difference, but so does having a clean space! So I literally went through every drawer and cleaned out EVERYTHING. There was so much stuff I didn’t even remember I had and never used, so we either trashed a lot of things or donated. I hope you enjoy this video and are feeling inspired to start 2020 on your best foot! SEE YOU IN THE NEW YEAR/DECADE!! #MassiveDeclutter #CleaningMontage #ApartmentDeclutter

I’m not sure if this was the best time to film this video because it was Thanksgiving week and also Black Friday..but here we are! I shared every purchase I made Monday through Friday…and well..it was a lot. Please keep in mind I do not spend this much money on a weekly basis, and if you want to see a more realistic weekly spending video (without Christmas shopping), let me know! #WhatISpendInAWeek #BlackFridayShopping

Follow me for exclusive giveaways and fashion inspo: https://www.instagram.com/emilydao_

I have been wanting to film this video for a long time and it’s finally the time!

KUDOS TO MONICA CHURCH FOR STARTING THIS TREND!

 I’m sure I’ve had other dumb purchases, but these really stood out due to their impact on my credit card debt and wallet. I used to justify these purchases because I was also saving money simultaneously so “it’s all about balance”…NO. Do not make that same mistake because most of these items are temporary and did not help me get to a better financial place. LESSON LEARNED to say the least! #DumbestPurchases

Also if you’re been around since the purple hair days..YOU ARE THE REAL MVP!

Follow me for exclusive giveaways and fashion inspo: https://www.instagram.com/emilydao_

I have been wanting to create another styling inspiration video, so I thought it would be fun to create outfits with thrifted items only! Disclaimer: It is extremely difficult for me personally to find pants/ bottoms and shoes that fit, so I had to substitute some of those pieces for non-thrifted items. Either way, I had a lot of fun creating these outfits. Some of these outfits are 100% thrifted from head to toe, but others were a little trickier. I hope you enjoy regardless and get inspiration! #ThriftedOutfits #Thrifted #OOTW

I’m so excited to start my new role working remotely from home, but first I had to make sure my desk sparked joy and would keep me focused the entire day. I decluttered many of the drawers on my Ikea desk and reorganized the layout to fit two computers AND an iPad. I also shopped for some useful organization items on Amazon that help save space when you have a compact desk (it’ll be linked below).

I made this video earlier this year, but wasn’t fully happy with the quality of it, so I decided to do it again! WOOH!

I went thrifting again today, and because my pup has separation anxiety, I decided to give myself an hour to shop! It was stressful to go through all the racks and do a dressing room try on all under one hour! I’m glad I was able to find some more essential pieces to add to my wardrobe though. I hope you enjoyed this video!

We’ve been adjusting to his needs and integrating him into our home and making sure it’s the best place to call home. We love him so much and can’t wait to watch him grow up!

I took you into the dressing room to show all the clothes I tried on and a haul at the end of what I got! #BacktoSchool #Thrifted #ClothingHaul

I haven’t thrifted in forever (and I kinda miss it), so I took you all with me and went to Crossroads Trading Co. There were so many cute (and not so cute) items that I tried on, but I loved the pieces I ended up purchasing. I hope you enjoyed this thrift haul and dressing room try on! Let me know if I should do a part 2 in the comments below!

I was working for 2 years, creating videos consistently, and building my brand behind the scenes so when my channel did go viral and get suggested by YouTube, I could really capitalize on that moment! So in today's video, I want to share some things that I always told my consultation clients. The things you really need to work on when your channel isn't growing, how to set up your brand up for success, and of course, how to stop waiting to go viral and what you can do TODAY to actually push your channel forward.

Lyrics
Donʼt think that I didnʼt notice this conversationʼs over
I see you looking around
Donʼt think that I didnʼt hear from friends of friends your talking 
Too bad you tend to be loud 

And to me itʼs so wi wi wild
How youʼre doing it with a smile 
And Iʼm watching it whi whi while 
While it backfires
Tryna keep it all low low low
But Iʼm taking a mental note 
Donʼt forget it, I know know know 
Youʼre a liar 

Give me nothing
But you want something from me 
You look like bad intentions
I see your motives
Itʼs so cute that
You want to use me donʼt you 
Thirsty for my attention
I see your motives 
You got you got you got you got you got you got motives 
You got you got you got you got motives 

You ask about me to somehow make it something about you 
No donʼt pretend that you care
Weʼre past the point of a resurrection
Thereʼs no returning 
So go ahead save your prayers 

And to me itʼs so wi wi wild
How youʼre doing it with a smile 
And Iʼm watching it whi whi while 
While it backfires
Tryna keep it all low low low
But Iʼm taking a mental note 
Donʼt forget it, I know know know 
Youʼre a liar 

Give me nothing
But you want something from me 
You look like bad intentions
I see your motives
Itʼs so cute that
You want to use me donʼt you 
Thirsty for my attention
I see your motives 
You got you got you got you got you got you got motives 
You got you got you got you got motives
You got you got you got you got you got you got motives 
You got you got you got you got motives

My vision so 20/20 yeah
No I donʼt want nothing to do with ya 
My vision so 20/20 yeah
No I donʼt want nothing to do with ya 

Give me nothing
But you want something from me 
You look like bad intentions
I see your motives
Itʼs so cute that
You want to use me donʼt you 
Thirsty for my attention
I see your motives 
You got you got you got you got you got you got motives 
You got you got you got you got motives

Lyrics
should’ve listened to my friends
they saw something I didn’t
should’ve seen it but your kiss it
broke my intuition 
 
you look so good but looks can be deceiving
you lie so well I almost believed it
 
you think I’d stay for your face
my heart was never that vain 
thought you’re worth my time and space
used your beauty like it’s currency
whats inside is such a shame
was it me or was it the game
don’t know who you think you are to act so cold
just because you’re hot
 
fights you started ended up
with me apologizing
and you’ll tell everyone we broke up just because of timing
 
you look so good but looks can be deceiving
you lie so well I almost believed it
 
you think I’d stay for your face
my heart was never that vain 
thought you’re worth my time and space
used your beauty like it’s currency
whats inside is such a shame
was it me or was it the game
don’t know who you think you are to act so cold
just because you’re hot
 
I know I’m better off right here by myself
save your smile for someone else

LYRICS:
“UNBREAKABLE""

THERE’S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOMEONE TRYIN’ TO TEAR YOU DOWN,
MOCKIN’ YOU
FOR YOUR MISTAKES.
OH-- THERE’S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOMEONE
MESSIN’ YOUR HEAD AROUND, WATCHIN’ YOU
TO SEE YOU BREAK.
SO--DON’TCHA LET ‘EM CALL YOU OUT
BRUSH AWAY THE SHAME AND DOUBT REMEMBER WHAT YOU’RE ALL ABOUT AND THEN-- SHOW ‘EM WHO YOU ARE
SHOW ‘EM THAT YOU’RE STRONG
SHOW ‘EM THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU BELONG. OPEN UP THEIR EYES, FORCE ‘EM ALL TO SEE
LET ‘EM KNOW YOU ARE AND YOU’LL ALWAYS BE UNBREAKABLE...
UNBREAKABLE...
UNBREAKABLE...
UNBREAKABLE...
YEAH

THERE’S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOMEONE SAYIN’ YOU’RE SOMETHIN’ LESS.
LET ‘EM TALK.
YOU KNOW YOUR HEART.
OH! THERE’S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOMEONE CALLIN’ YOU SECOND-BEST.
SHUT ‘EM DOWN,
DON’T FALL APART
NO--DON’TCHA LET ‘EM IN YOUR HEAD.
DOESN’T MATTER WHAT THEY SAID
GET UP ON YOUR FEET INSTEAD AND THEN-- SHOW ‘EM WHO YOU ARE
SHOW ‘EM THAT YOU’RE STRONG
SHOW ‘EM THEY’VE BEEN SEEING YOU ALL WRONG OPEN UP THEIR MINDS,
THROW AWAY THE KEY
TELL ‘EM THAT YOU ARE AND YOU’LL ALWAYS BE UNBREAKABLE...
UNBREAKABLE...
YEAH
YOU DEFINE YOURSELF
YOU AND NO ONE ELSE SHOW ‘EM WHO YOU ARE
SHOW ‘EM THAT YOU’RE STRONG...
SHOW ‘EM THAT YOU’VE KNOWN IT ALL ALONG! OPEN EV’RY DOOR,
OWN YOUR DESTINY
LIVE AS IF YOU ARE WHAT YOU WERE
AND YOU’VE BEEN
AND YOU’LL ALWAYS BE... UNBREAKABLE... UNBREAKABLE... UNBREAKABLE... UNBREAKABLE... UNBREAKABLE!",2019-04-30T19:00:03.000Z

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 8 and Pearl, 1). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again! 

I try to upload every Wednesday evening and Sunday at 9am!

They didn't ask me to feature them, the day or their brand at all, I just think they're really good eggs, have worked with them lots over the years and enjoy shouting out good brands with good products and services. Oofff, that was a big disclaimer!

About Me ::

Hi, I'm Louise! I started this channel in 2009 after readers of my blog (also called Sprinkle of Glitter) suggested I give YouTube a try. I was instantly hooked and have found my internet playground on here. I make videos about beauty & fashion, positive living, motherhood, lifestyle and occasionally have special guests (friends, kittens or my sweet Daughters Darcy, 8 and Pearl, 1). Hit the subscribe button to never miss a video again! 

I try to upload every Wednesday at 5pm and Sunday at 9am!

I chat every day on my other social media (linked above) so do come and say hi! 

Big hugs,

Eat up! Subscribe to WUM for new vids! http://bit.ly/sub2moms 

Vegan
INGREDIENTS
- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 tbsp almond milk
- 2 tbsp oil
- 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup vegan chocolate chips

DIRECTIONS
1. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, sugar and brown sugar in a medium bowl and stir.
2. Add almond milk, oil and vanilla and mix. You want your dough to stick together but it will not be a wet dough. If it's not sticking together, add more almond milk 1 tsp at a time.
3. Form into one big ball, then roll into a log, wrap and put into freezer for at least 30 minutes.
4. Once dough is chilled, slice into 1/2 inch slices and place onto parchment-lined baking sheet.
5. Bake at 325 degrees for 11 minutes. They’ll look underdone when you take them out. Let them cool on the baking tray 10 minutes before touching, during which time they will firm up. 

Keto
INGREDIENTS
- 1/4 cup softened butter
- 6 tbsp monk fruit
- 2 tbsp + 2 tsp coconut oil (I used refined)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp xanthan gum
- 1.5 cups almond flour
- 6 tbsp Keto Chocolate chips

DIRECTIONS
1. In a large bowl, mix together butter, monk fruit, and coconut oil. Add vanilla extract and egg; mix until combined.
2. Add salt, baking soda, and xanthan gum and continue to mix.
3. Add in the almond flour 1/2 cup at a time. 
4. Fold in chocolate chips.
5. Drop dough by the teaspoon onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, and push down slightly. Bake at 350 degree for 12-14 minutes, or until golden around the edges.

Paleo
INGREDIENTS
- 12 pitted dates
- 1 cup walnuts (pecans work too)
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/8 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks (or dark chocolate chips) 

DIRECTIONS
1. Blend dates and walnuts in a food processor until finely ground.
2. Add egg, vanilla, salt and baking soda and blend to combine.
3. Fold in chocolate chunks or chips.
4. Spoon onto parchment covered cookie sheets (using an ice cream scoop is great with this sticky dough).
5. Bake at 350 for 9-11 minutes, but push them down with slightly damp fingers at the 3 minute mark. They should be golden but still soft in the middle. Let them cool (they will firm up).

Pancrepes
INGREDIENTS
- 1/2 cup lowfat cottage cheese
- 3 eggs
- 2 tbsp cup oil 
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/4 cup flour
- dash salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar

DIRECTIONS
1.  In blender, mix all the ingredients being sure batter is smooth but not overmixed.

2.  Butter 9-10 inch skillet (I love using ghee since it can sit on your counter at room temperature).  Heat over medium low heat until pan is very hot.  Pour batter into a small circle on skillet and then swirl pan so that batter is very thin.

3.  Cook on each side for about a minute.  Flipping is the only tricky part and using a big spatula helps; also, don't flip to early!

Egg Muffin Bites
INGREDIENTS
- 8 eggs
- 3 tbsp milk
- 2 tbsp shredded cheese
- any toppings you like

DIRECTIONS
1.  Whisk together eggs and milk.  Butter a mini muffin pan very well and fill muffins about 3/4 full.

2.  Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes.

Greek Yogurt Bar
INGREDIENTS
- 1 cup greek yogurt
- maple syrup to taste
- bee pollen
- flax seed meal
- blueberries
- walnuts
- cinnamon

So, let's try it!  Chit chat about my secret Jenna Marbles theories, a story of lost innocence and purity and whatever else came to mind.  Put this on in the background of whatever you're doing now and just hang out with me.

1527,DcdDxdl_4XU,UC_YydHJ2xTRctvZgAq2YC1A,Procesessing Loss - (A Hard Day),"When I recorded this video I wasn't able to verbalize exactly why I was struggling so much that day.  It wasn't just remembering the loss, or even the trauma that I went through with my mom.  (If you're new, she passed away after an immensely traumatic illness.  I was her only family and care taker for the last decade.  I felt like I lived in death and suffering instead of life).   Every year, around this time, my physical body reacts to those past moments.   It feels like some sort of muscle memory that I never see coming. It's hard to breathe, hard to talk, hard to feel the ground below me, hard to stop sobbing.  It's been three years now, but my body is still responding to what she and I experienced in those last days.  This is a side of grief I didn't expect or know how to prepare for.  It unhinges me.  I spoke with a counselor and plan to continue with counseling as I process.  I wanted to share on instagram (couldn't in the video) because if I'm going through this then so are others who've lost loved ones in a traumatic way.  Grief is the worst place to feel alone.  You're not.  I love you.

Acne  and acne scarring has really affected my confidence over the years so I thought I would start a monthly video series to document if and how my skin improves over the next year. I'll share the treatments I try, the products I love (and don't) and share everything I learn along the way.

I really hope you enjoy this video! And its helpful to someone out there

1552,Wa6qYwKTUUw,UCu1mddIGKJPd8K-gJn5iFBw,WE GOT A BIG SUPRISE! | KATE MURNANE AD,"AD Hi guys thanks so much for watching our day with Cubby from Hasbro. Cubby will excitedly take part in all kids adventures, and snuggle next to them at the end of day. He hugs them back, plays peek-a-boo, dances, makes eating sounds and in night time mode, he closes his eyes, makes sleepy sounds, and plays one of four 5-minute sequences of soft music.
If you would like to win your very own Cubby The Curious Bear simply comment below a place you and your children would take Cubby for the day! Be subscribed to my channel.  The competition will be open for 1 week (16th-23rd October) You must be over 18 and in the UK to enter. To find out more about Cubby click here: https://bit.ly/2Mqfddj

 Please note: I used some editing magic at the start of this video – while he does lots of things, Cubby doesn’t really move around on his own : )

We recently had the chance to go on a whirlwind 24 hour trip to Berlin with Kia to test drive the all new Kia XCeed. I have to admit, it wasn't somewhere very high up on my list of places to visit, but after learning more about the history of the city and visiting some of the most coolest places I'm now SO glad we did! Even if you only visit for a few days, It's definitely worth seeing what the city has to offer.

SHOP THE NEW MIDDLE KID: https://middlekid.supply
** For my bday, I wanted to do something I've never done before and get a nice house with friends in a beautiful location was just that. I could go on and on about how privileged and bless and how unreal my life is/feels but I already did that on instagram. I just am genuinely appreciative of every single person who supports me and shows me love and everything in between. This trip especially made me feel weak with gratitude of just how lucky I am. Thank you until the end of time. Enjoy my 26th birthday trip x

** I really cant believe I waited over a year to make this but nothing quite like bon appetit coming out with a similar gourmet version to make you feel like now's the time. I lived off of hot pockets when I was younger so I wanted to update them and to try and make them vegan so I made vegan hot pockets in my favorite flavors: pepperoni pizza, ham and cheddar, and finally chicken broccoli and cheddar. bon appetite indeed!!!!!

I am not, however, a licensed dermatologist or esthetician, nor do I claim to know more than either.

30% off 12 months subscription: https://lifesum.com/redeem/drmike30

The first cooking with me video was a blast but I decided to step it up this time and try cooking sous vide. This is a cooking style that allows you to slow cook just about anything in a pot using a zip lock bag. I was fascinated when I learned of this cooking style and decided to try it out for the first time on camera! Try not to judge me too harshly on my weak cooking skills. I promise I'm striving to get better so constructive criticism is welcome!

Many of my friends texted me asking similar questions. Instead of micro analyzing every point in the documentary I decided to approach it from a broad stroke perspective.

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

1) Cracking knuckles

2) My patients

3) CPR and Ribs

4) Bear Pup

I know we all love to run to google search whenever we have a medical question and sometimes that type of searching is great but it can easily get sidetracked based on the autocomplete or just getting weird search results. 

I decided to transform the classic Autocomplete video format on its side and just react to my google searches as we cover a specific topic each week. This week that topic issssss... ""Doctors"", Yay =] 

I hope you enjoy this new format and if you do please be sure to like and comment to let me know.

LYRICS:

No me busques pleito 
Así que olvídalo
Puede jugar con otras
Pero conmigo no
Si te pasas de la raya 
Es mejor que corras 
Y mejor rézale a dios 
A dios

Ten cuidao si tu tiene otra falda 
Te descubro esa y las que salgan 
La mirada siempre te delata
No me gusta la gente barata

Así que no vengas con tu palabreo 
Mucha inmadurez en ti es lo que veo 
Yo por ti metí las manos en el fuego 
Y te equivocaste feo

En las buenas y en las malas 
Yo siempre estuve ahí pa ti 
En las buenas y en las malas 
Tu no estuviste ahí pa mi 
Hubo lluvia en mis ojos 
Ahora quédate solo
En las buenas y en las malas 
Papito ya te puedes ir
vete pa la

Tengo una amiga bruja y otra espía 
La otra trabaja en la cia
Cuidao con quien salgas en la foto 
No te metas con el combo peligroso 
Y Si amanece
Y tu no apareces
te sale castigo
Tu lo mereces
Tu no puedes con una a la vez 
Solo un estupido
Hace esa estupidez

Así que no vengas con tu palabreo 
Mucha inmadurez en ti es lo que veo 
Yo por ti metí las manos en el fuego 
Y te equivocaste feo

En las buenas y en las malas 
Yo siempre estuve ahí pa ti 
En las buenas y en las malas 
Tu no estuviste ahí pa mi 
Hubo lluvia en mis ojos 
Ahora quédate solo
En las buenas y en las malas 
Papito ya te puedes ir
vete pa la

Te puedes ir 
Lejos de aquí 
Yo te dije 
vete pa la

Te puedes ir 
Lejos de aquí 
Yo te dije 
vete pa la
